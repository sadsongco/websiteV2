      <h1>The Exact Opposite</h1>
      <p>You liked Dive Dive so you might like our new band...</p>
      <p>You may be interested to know that Jamie and I have started something new called The Exact Opposite, which is a development of everything we were doing in Dive Dive. Your first, and natural, reaction may well be "PLAY ME SOMETHING!". We're keeping everything under wraps for the time being, but because you're part of our special gang, here's a secret YouTube link to one of the tracks. PLEASE don't share this with anyone - we're talking to labels about releasing, and want to keep our powder dry until that is all sorted. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOVYobU5dJc">You Work For Us Now (rehearsal video)</a></p>
      <p>We're much too polite to just automatically add you to the new TEO mailing list. If you would like to get news from us, please click the link below. We won't spam you, and as far as privacy goes, we'll never sell or share your email with anyone. If we do sign, the label will inevitably ask, but we'll tell them to get stuffed.</p>
      <p>I'm really excited about the album that we're working on. It sounds fresh and vigorous. I hope you can share in the journey with us!</p>
